# Custom Macropad

A completely custom-built customizable macropad I built as a gift for a friend. Completed officially on March 11 2024.

Features:
- 3D printed enclosure
- Laser cut 1.5mm acrylic plate
- Custom PCB 
- QMK VIAL firmware 

All of my design files are collected within this repository. Some other items that you may need to purchase to complete this build:
- Standard Mechanical Keyboard Switches with a CherryMX footprint (used Wuque Studio Browns)
- SEED XIAO RP2040 Microcontroller
- 1N4148 Small Signal Switching Diodes
- EC11 (used Alps EC11E15244B2-ND)

Some tools I used:
- 3D Printers
- Laser Cutters
- AutoCAD for designing the acrylic plate
- Solidworks for designing the enclosure
- KiCAD for the circuit schematic and PCB gerbers

## Next Steps
- The rotary encoders are WAY too close to the keycaps, making it difficult to rotate (although it does thankfully actually rotate). They should be moved such that they are placed further away from the keycaps by at least 5mm or so.
